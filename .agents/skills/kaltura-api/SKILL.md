# Kaltura API Integration

Kaltura — The Agentic Digital Experience Platform. Kaltura is powering rich, agentic digital experiences across organizational journeys for customers, employees, learners, and audiences. The Kaltura platform combines intelligent content creation, enterprise-grade content management and intelligence, and multimodal conversational engagement capabilities. Kaltura serves leading enterprises, financial institutions, educational institutions, media and telecom providers, and other organizations worldwide.

This skill gives you the knowledge map to build any integration on Kaltura's 100+ REST API services.

## Platform Overview

The platform is built on three core layers:

- **Intelligent Content Creation** — Recording, editing, AI-assisted content generation (transcription, translation, captioning, dubbing, summarization, chaptering, clipping, quiz generation), and avatar-based video creation
- **Enterprise-Grade Content Management and Intelligence** — Centralized management of live and on-demand content with metadata, permissions, workflows, analytics, and AI-driven workflow agents for automated content lifecycle operations
- **Multimodal Conversational Engagement** — Content hubs, virtual events and webinars, player embeds, LMS/CMS integrations, conversational AI agents (Kaltura Genies and Agentic Avatars), and TV streaming applications

Content is organized as **entries** (media objects with metadata, flavors, thumbnails, and captions). Every API call requires a **Kaltura Session (KS)** — a signed, time-limited auth token.

## Authentication

Two auth methods, depending on context:

| Method | When to Use | How |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| `session.start` | Internal backend tools where you control the environment | POST with `partnerId` + `adminSecret` → returns KS |
| `appToken.startSession` | Production integrations, partner apps, microservices | HMAC exchange with a pre-created token — no admin secret exposed |

KS types: **USER** (type=0) for end-user operations, **ADMIN** (type=2) for backend-only management.

For full auth details, KS privileges, and AppToken HMAC workflow:
- [Session Guide](../../../KALTURA_SESSION_GUIDE.md) — KS generation, types, privileges, security practices
- [AppTokens API](../../../KALTURA_APPTOKENS_API.md) — Create, distribute, and rotate scoped tokens
- [Auth Broker API](../../../KALTURA_AUTH_BROKER_API.md) — SSO/SAML configuration, app subscriptions, federated login

## API Patterns

### API v3 (most services)

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/{service}/action/{action}" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "param[key]=value"
```

- **Base URL:** `https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3`
- Form-encoded POST, always include `format=1` for JSON responses
- Nested params use bracket notation: `filter[nameContains]=test`

### Modern JSON APIs

Some newer services use JSON bodies with auth headers:

| API | Base URL | Auth Header |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| Events Platform | `https://events-api.nvp1.ovp.kaltura.com/api/v1` | `Authorization: Bearer $KALTURA_KS` |
| App Registry | `https://app-registry.nvp1.ovp.kaltura.com/api/v1` | `Authorization: Bearer $KALTURA_KS` |
| User Profile | `https://user.nvp1.ovp.kaltura.com/api/v1` | `Authorization: Bearer $KALTURA_KS` |
| Agents Manager | `https://agents-manager.nvp1.ovp.kaltura.com` | `Authorization: Bearer $KALTURA_KS` |
| AI Genie | `https://genie.nvp1.ovp.kaltura.com` | `Authorization: KS $KALTURA_KS` |
| Messaging | `https://messaging.nvp1.ovp.kaltura.com/api/v1` | `Authorization: Bearer $KALTURA_KS` |
| Auth Broker | `https://auth.nvp1.ovp.kaltura.com/api/v1` | `Authorization: KS $KALTURA_KS` |
| Reports Microservice | `https://reports.nvp1.ovp.kaltura.com` | `Authorization: Bearer $KALTURA_KS` |
| Game Services (SCM) | `https://scm.nvp1.ovp.kaltura.com/api/v1` | `Authorization: Bearer $KALTURA_KS` |

> **Regional deployments** may use different base URLs (e.g., `irp2` for EU, `frp2` for DE). The URLs above are for the default NVP1 (US) region. Check your Kaltura account configuration for the correct regional endpoints.

## Common Integration Flows

### Upload → Process → Deliver → Embed

1. **Upload** content via chunked upload or import-from-URL
2. **Poll** for entry status to reach READY (status=2)
3. **Enrich** with REACH services (captions, translation, moderation, 23 service types) or Agents
4. **Search** your content library with eSearch
5. **Embed** the player in your application

### Entry Status Lifecycle

| Status | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| ERROR_IMPORTING | -2 | Import failed |
| ERROR_CONVERTING | -1 | Transcoding failed |
| IMPORT | 0 | File being fetched/imported |
| PRECONVERT | 1 | Queued for transcoding |
| READY | 2 | Fully processed, playable |
| DELETED | 3 | Entry deleted |
| PENDING | 4 | Pending processing |
| MODERATE | 5 | Awaiting moderation |
| BLOCKED | 6 | Blocked by admin |
| NO_CONTENT | 7 | Entry created, no media attached |

### Upload Lifecycle

```
uploadToken.add → uploadToken.upload (one or more chunks) → media.add → media.addContent
```

Use `media.addContent` with the appropriate resource type: `KalturaUploadedFileTokenResource` (local upload), `KalturaUrlResource` (URL import), `KalturaEntryResource` (copy from entry).

Boolean Event Notification Templates serve as conditions for REACH Automation Rules (documented in the REACH guide).

### LMS Integration

KAF (Kaltura Application Framework) accepts LTI 1.1 (OAuth 1.0a) and LTI 1.3 (JWT/OIDC) launches and renders modules (My Media, Media Gallery, Content Picker, Genie AI, Avatar Studio, Meeting Room) inside LMS iframes. Covers authentication flows, privacy context, deep linking, grade passback, Caliper analytics, KAF standalone (KS-SSO), and SIS provisioning via Kaltura APIs.

## Security & Best Practices

When building on Kaltura, follow these principles for production-quality integrations:

- **Use AppTokens for production auth.** Generate KS server-side via AppTokens; keep `adminSecret` on the server only. Create scoped tokens with minimal privileges and rotate periodically. See [AppTokens API](../../../KALTURA_APPTOKENS_API.md).
- **Prefer USER KS (type=0)** for end-user operations. Reserve ADMIN KS (type=2) for backend-only management. Scope privileges with `edit:`, `sview:`, `setrole:`, `iprestrict:`.
- **Verify webhook signatures.** Validate `SHA256(signing_secret + body)` on all incoming HTTP webhooks before processing.
- **Use Kaltura's built-in services** rather than reimplementing. REACH for enrichment services (captions, translation, moderation, and more), Agents Manager for automated processing, Messaging for email delivery, eSearch for search, Access Control for content protection.
- **Handle errors and retries.** Check every API response for error codes. Implement exponential backoff for transient failures (HTTP 500, rate limits). Log error codes for debugging.
- **Set short KS expiry.** Default to 1-4 hour sessions. Use AppToken session renewal rather than long-lived admin sessions.
- **Sanitize inputs.** Validate user-provided entry IDs, search terms, and metadata before passing to API calls.
- **Use CAN-SPAM compliant email patterns.** Include unsubscribe links and respect opt-out preferences when using the Messaging API.

## Environment Setup

```bash
export KALTURA_SERVICE_URL="https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3"
export KALTURA_PARTNER_ID="your_partner_id"
export KALTURA_KS="your_kaltura_session"
```

Regional deployments may use different base URLs. Check with your Kaltura account configuration.
