# Kaltura REACH API Guide

Kaltura REACH is a **governed, budget-controlled marketplace for content enrichment services**. It provides a unified API for ordering any enrichment task — from machine-generated captions to professional human translations, AI-powered content moderation to conversational AI agents — against your media entries. Services are delivered by both **Machine/AI engines** and **Human Professional vendors**, supporting **80+ languages**. Results (caption files, audio tracks, chapters, metadata, moderation reports) are delivered directly back into Kaltura and attached to the entry automatically.

REACH centralizes the management of enrichment services across your organization: credit budgets per account and department, moderation workflows for quality control, content deletion policies for privacy compliance, and vendor abstraction that ensures third-party providers never get direct access to your account. Customers pre-purchase credits that can be used across any integrated service during the contract period.

**Base URL:** `https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3` (may differ by region/deployment)  
**Auth:** KS passed as `ks` parameter in POST form data (see [Session Guide](KALTURA_SESSION_GUIDE.md))  
**Format:** Form-encoded POST, `format=1` for JSON responses  

REACH services can be triggered manually via the API, automatically via REACH profile automation rules (using Boolean event notification conditions), via [Kaltura Agents](KALTURA_AGENTS_MANAGER_API.md), or through the KMC/KMS management UIs.

# 1. When to Use

Use REACH when your application needs any form of content enrichment — from making videos searchable and accessible, to repurposing long-form content into short clips, to moderating uploads at scale. REACH provides a single unified API for 23 enrichment service types across 80+ languages, delivered by both machine/AI engines and human professional vendors.

**Concrete scenarios where REACH is the right approach:**

| Scenario | REACH Services | Outcome |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Make a video library searchable by spoken content | Machine Captions (ASR) → eSearch indexes transcripts | Users find videos by keywords spoken in them |
| Localize training content for global teams | Captions + Translation (80+ languages) or Dubbing | Multi-language captions or dubbed audio tracks on each entry |
| Meet accessibility compliance (WCAG, Section 508) | Professional Captions + Audio Description + Sign Language | Closed captions, narrated visuals, and sign language tracks |
| Auto-generate social clips from webinars | AI Clips (Content Lab) | Multiple short highlight clips with AI-generated titles and descriptions |
| Build a quiz from a lecture recording | Quiz generation | Interactive quiz questions attached as cue points on the entry |
| Moderate user-generated uploads before publishing | Content Moderation (AI) | Moderation scores and flags; auto-block or queue for review |
| Create chapter navigation for long recordings | Chaptering (AI + human review) | Chapter cue points for in-player navigation |
| Summarize meetings for async viewers | Summary | AI-generated summary and auto-chapters in entry metadata |
| Extract key topics and tags for content discovery | Intelligent Tagging + Metadata Enrichment | Auto-generated tags and keywords on each entry |
| Caption live events in real time | Live Captions or Live Translation | Real-time subtitles injected into the HLS stream |
| Add conversational AI over a content library | Immersive Agent (Chat or Call) | Text or voice-based Q&A grounded in video content |
| Generate avatar videos from scripts | Avatar VOD | Pre-recorded avatar videos from text input |

**When to use REACH vs. other approaches:**

- **REACH API directly** — Use for on-demand, per-entry enrichment requests from your application code.
- **REACH Automation Rules** — Use for automatic enrichment of all uploads (or uploads matching conditions) without writing per-entry code. Configure once on your REACH profile.
- **Agents Manager** — Use for multi-step orchestrated workflows (e.g., "caption, then translate to 3 languages, then summarize") with event-driven triggers and retry logic.
- **Content Lab widget** — Use to give end-users a self-service UI for ordering clips, summaries, chapters, and quizzes from within the Kaltura player experience.


# 2. Prerequisites

- Know how to generate Kaltura Sessions (KS) in your backend (see [Session Guide](KALTURA_SESSION_GUIDE.md))
- Have a Kaltura account with REACH services enabled (contact your Kaltura account manager to provision)

**Endpoint pattern:**
```
POST https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3/service/{serviceName}/action/{actionName}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

All parameters are passed as form data. Always include `ks=<YOUR_KS>` and `format=1` (JSON response).


## What REACH Provides

REACH is an open marketplace — the services listed below are current as of this writing, but the platform is designed to integrate any enrichment service. Each service can be provided by Machine/AI engines, Human Professional vendors, or both, depending on vendor availability for your account.

### Captioning & Transcription
- **Machine Captions (ASR)** — AI-powered, ~85% accuracy, up to 2-hour turnaround. Supports custom vocabularies/dictionaries for domain-specific terminology.
- **Professional (Human) Captions** — 99%+ accuracy, 3-48 hour turnaround depending on SLA tier. Compliant with closed captioning standards.
- **Live Captions** — Real-time machine-generated captions for scheduled live events.
- **Alignment** — Upload an existing transcript file and REACH syncs it to the audio timeline.

### Translation & Localization
- **Translation** — Three modes: (1) translate directly from audio, (2) translate from existing captions file, (3) order professional captions first, then translate. 80+ languages supported.
- **Live Translation** — Real-time machine-generated subtitles in a different language during live events.
- **Dubbing** — Machine-based translated audio via text-to-speech, synced to original dialogue timing.

### Accessibility
- **Standard Audio Description** — Narration of visual elements mixed with original audio.
- **Extended Audio Description** — Pauses video to allow detailed narration of visual content. Uses speech synthesis from time-coded VTT. Requires player plugin.
- **Sign Language** — Creates a child entry with sign language video (ASL or BSL) linked to the parent entry.

### Intelligence & Analysis
- **AI Clips** — Automatically generate short clips/highlights from longer content using AI analysis. Machine-powered, immediate turnaround.
- **Quiz** — AI-generated quiz questions from video content.
- **Video Analysis** — Visual content analysis including OCR (optical character recognition).
- **Intelligent Tagging** — Automatic topic extraction and semantic tagging from transcript content.
- **Sentiment Analysis** — AI-powered sentiment and tone analysis of spoken content.
- **Content Moderation** — Screen video transcripts and frames against configurable moderation policies using LLMs and computer vision. See [Moderation API](KALTURA_MODERATION_API.md) for policies, rules, and scoring.

### Content Enrichment
- **Chaptering** — AI-based chapter detection, reviewed by professionals. 24-hour turnaround.
- **Summary** — AI-generated content summary with auto-chaptering.
- **Metadata Enrichment** — Automatic tags, keywords, and metadata extraction.
- **Document Enrichment** — AI-powered enrichment for document-type entries.

### Conversational AI
- **Immersive Agent Chat** — Text-based conversational AI agent interaction over content.
- **Immersive Agent Call** — Voice-based conversational AI agent interaction over content.

### Governance & Billing
REACH services are billed in **credits**, defined per REACH profile. Credit balances, usage, and limits are managed through the REACH profile configuration. Key governance features:

- **Credit management** — Per-account, per-instance (KMS/KAF app), and per-department budgets. Central reporting of usage and billing.
- **Moderation workflows** — Approval/rejection of enrichment task requests with email notifications, controlling when credits are spent.
- **Content deletion policy** — Configure when source content is deleted from vendor systems after processing, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, DPA).
- **Vendor abstraction** — Third-party vendors receive only time-expired tokens with access to the specific entry being processed, never your account credentials or broader content access.
- **Automation rules** — Define per-channel/category or account-wide rules for automatic enrichment ordering based on content events.

### Language Support

REACH services support 80+ languages including: English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Hindi, Hebrew, Italian, Thai, Swedish, Polish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Dutch, Hungarian, Romanian, Vietnamese, Czech, Greek, Indonesian, Turkish, Ukrainian, Welsh, Irish, Catalan, Tamil, Bulgarian, Estonian, Lithuanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Croatian, Farsi, Galician, Malay, Marathi, Mongolian, Taiwanese Mandarin, Afrikaans, Icelandic, Malayalam, Urdu, Zulu, Azerbaijani, Burmese, Bosnian, Georgian, Gujarati, Javanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Macedonian, Nepali, Punjabi, Serbian, Uzbek, Xhosa, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and more. Language availability varies by service type and vendor.


## Core Concepts

| Concept | What It Is |
|---|---|
| **REACH Profile** | Per-account configuration that defines credit allocation, output preferences (format, moderation, metadata extraction, speaker identification, profanity removal), dictionaries, and content deletion policy. |
| **Vendor Catalog Item** | A specific service offering from a vendor — e.g., "English Machine Captions, 2-hour TAT" or "Spanish Human Translation, 5 Business Days". Each has a unique `catalogItemId`. |
| **Entry Vendor Task** | A single unit of work: one service applied to one entry. Created by referencing a `catalogItemId` and an `entryId`. |

The typical flow: discover available catalog items for your account, then create a task against an entry using the desired catalog item.

## Full Example: Order Machine Captions for an Entry

### Step-by-Step curl Example

Set up shell variables (see [Session Guide](KALTURA_SESSION_GUIDE.md) for generating a KS):

```bash
export KALTURA_SERVICE_URL="https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3"
export KALTURA_PARTNER_ID="YOUR_PARTNER_ID"
export KALTURA_KS="YOUR_KS"
```

**Step 1: Find available machine caption catalog items**

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/reach_vendorCatalogItem/action/list" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "filter[serviceTypeEqual]=2" \
  -d "filter[serviceFeatureEqual]=1" \
  -d "filter[sourceLanguageEqual]=English" \
  -d "filter[statusEqual]=2"
```

From the response, note the `id` of the desired catalog item (e.g., `101`). Always verify the `sourceLanguage` field in the returned objects matches your target language — the server-side filter works best when combined with client-side validation.

**Step 2: Get your REACH profile ID**

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/reach_reachProfile/action/list" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "filter[statusEqual]=2"
```

From the response, note the `id` of your active REACH profile (e.g., `1001`).

**Step 3: Order captions for an entry**

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/reach_entryVendorTask/action/add" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "entryVendorTask[objectType]=KalturaEntryVendorTask" \
  -d "entryVendorTask[entryId]=$KALTURA_ENTRY_ID" \
  -d "entryVendorTask[reachProfileId]=$REACH_PROFILE_ID" \
  -d "entryVendorTask[catalogItemId]=$CATALOG_ITEM_ID"
```

From the response, note the task `id` (e.g., `98765`) and `expectedFinishTime`.

**Step 4: Poll for completion**

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/reach_entryVendorTask/action/get" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "id=$VENDOR_TASK_ID"
```

Poll every 30 seconds until `status` is `2` (READY) or `6` (ERROR). When READY, the response includes `outputObjectId` (the caption asset ID) and `accuracy` (percentage). If ERROR, check `errDescription` for details.


## AI Clips Workflow (Content Lab)

AI Clips uses the REACH task system to analyze a video and automatically generate multiple short highlight clips with AI-generated titles, descriptions, and tags. This is exposed in the KMC as "Content Lab".

The workflow has two phases: **Generate** (AI creates clip suggestions as child entries) and **Save** (clone a clip into a standalone entry with trimmed content).

### Phase 1: Generate AI Clips

Order clip generation by creating a REACH task with `KalturaClipsVendorTaskData`:

**`entryVendorTask.add`**

```
ks=<YOUR_KS>
&format=1
&entryVendorTask[objectType]=KalturaEntryVendorTask
&entryVendorTask[entryId]=1_abc123def
&entryVendorTask[reachProfileId]=1001
&entryVendorTask[catalogItemId]=34832
&entryVendorTask[taskJobData][objectType]=KalturaClipsVendorTaskData
&entryVendorTask[taskJobData][outputLanguage]=English
&entryVendorTask[taskJobData][clipsDuration]=120
&entryVendorTask[taskJobData][instruction]=Generate highlights focusing on key announcements
&entryVendorTask[taskJobData][eventSessionContextId]=
```

**`KalturaClipsVendorTaskData` fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `outputLanguage` | string | Language for generated clip titles/descriptions (e.g., "English") |
| `clipsDuration` | int | Maximum duration per clip in **seconds** |
| `instruction` | string | Free-text instruction for the AI (topic focus, style guidance) |
| `eventSessionContextId` | string | Optional session context ID for tracking |

The task starts in `PENDING` (1) and moves to `PROCESSING` (3). Poll with `entryVendorTask.get` until `READY` (2). Typical completion time is 30-60 seconds.

### Phase 2: List Generated Clips

Once the task is `READY`, the AI has created multiple child entries linked to the source. Retrieve them:

**`baseEntry.list`** — find clips by source entry ID:

```
ks=<YOUR_KS>
&format=1
&filter[rootEntryIdIn]=1_abc123def
&filter[statusIn]=1,2,4
&filter[orderBy]=-createdAt
&pager[pageSize]=500
```

Each generated clip is a full media entry with:
- AI-generated `name` (clip title)
- AI-generated `description` (clip summary)
- AI-generated `tags`
- `rootEntryId` pointing back to the source entry
- Its own `duration`, `thumbnailUrl`, etc.

**`playlist.list`** — clips may also be grouped in a path playlist:

```
ks=<YOUR_KS>
&format=1
&filter[referenceIdEqual]=1_abc123def
&filter[playListTypeEqual]=3
&pager[pageSize]=500
```

### Phase 3: Save a Clip as a Standalone Entry

To save a specific clip as an independent entry (with its own trimmed video content), use the three-step pattern: **clone → trim → set metadata**.

**Step 1: Clone the source entry**

```
ks=<YOUR_KS>
&format=1
&entryId=1_abc123def
&cloneOptions:item1:objectType=KalturaBaseEntryCloneOptionComponent
&cloneOptions:item1:itemType=5
&cloneOptions:item1:rule=1
&cloneOptions:item2:objectType=KalturaBaseEntryCloneOptionComponent
&cloneOptions:item2:itemType=2
&cloneOptions:item2:rule=1
&cloneOptions:item3:objectType=KalturaBaseEntryCloneOptionComponent
&cloneOptions:item3:itemType=6
&cloneOptions:item3:rule=1
&cloneOptions:item4:objectType=KalturaBaseEntryCloneOptionComponent
&cloneOptions:item4:itemType=7
&cloneOptions:item4:rule=1
&cloneOptions:item5:objectType=KalturaBaseEntryCloneOptionComponent
&cloneOptions:item5:itemType=1
&cloneOptions:item5:rule=1
```

Clone option `itemType` values: `1` (content), `2` (access control), `5` (categories), `6` (metadata), `7` (flavors).

**Step 2: Trim the cloned entry to clip boundaries**

Use `media.updateContent` with `KalturaClipAttributes`. Offset and duration are in **milliseconds**:

```
ks=<YOUR_KS>
&format=1
&entryId=<CLONED_ENTRY_ID>
&resource[objectType]=KalturaOperationResources
&resource[resources][0][objectType]=KalturaOperationResource
&resource[resources][0][resource][objectType]=KalturaEntryResource
&resource[resources][0][resource][entryId]=1_abc123def
&resource[resources][0][resource][flavorParamsId]=487091
&resource[resources][0][operationAttributes][0][objectType]=KalturaClipAttributes
&resource[resources][0][operationAttributes][0][offset]=350
&resource[resources][0][operationAttributes][0][duration]=205930
```

To include burned-in captions, add `captionAttributes`:

```
&resource[resources][0][operationAttributes][0][captionAttributes][0][objectType]=KalturaRenderCaptionAttributes
&resource[resources][0][operationAttributes][0][captionAttributes][0][captionAssetId]=$CAPTION_ASSET_ID
```

- `offset` — Start position in milliseconds from the source entry
- `duration` — Clip length in milliseconds
- `flavorParamsId` — Get from `flavorAsset.list` on the source entry (use the original or a ready flavor)
- `captionAssetId` — Optional; get from `captionAsset.list` to burn captions into the clip

**Step 3: Set metadata on the saved clip**

```
ks=<YOUR_KS>
&format=1
&entryId=<CLONED_ENTRY_ID>
&mediaEntry[objectType]=KalturaMediaEntry
&mediaEntry[name]=Introduction to DLI and Its Importance
&mediaEntry[description]=Stephen Wells introduces the session...
&mediaEntry[tags]=DLI, Deep Learning Institute, AI Education
&mediaEntry[displayInSearch]=1
```

The saved clip will go through server-side transcoding (status `4` = PENDING) and become `READY` (2) when processing completes.

### Step-by-Step curl Example: Full AI Clips Workflow

Set up shell variables (see [Session Guide](KALTURA_SESSION_GUIDE.md) for generating a KS):

```bash
export KALTURA_SERVICE_URL="https://www.kaltura.com/api_v3"
export KALTURA_PARTNER_ID="YOUR_PARTNER_ID"
export KALTURA_KS="YOUR_KS"
```

**Step 1: Order AI clip generation**

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/reach_entryVendorTask/action/add" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "entryVendorTask[objectType]=KalturaEntryVendorTask" \
  -d "entryVendorTask[entryId]=$KALTURA_ENTRY_ID" \
  -d "entryVendorTask[reachProfileId]=$REACH_PROFILE_ID" \
  -d "entryVendorTask[catalogItemId]=$CATALOG_ITEM_ID" \
  -d "entryVendorTask[taskJobData][objectType]=KalturaClipsVendorTaskData" \
  -d "entryVendorTask[taskJobData][outputLanguage]=English" \
  -d "entryVendorTask[taskJobData][clipsDuration]=120" \
  -d "entryVendorTask[taskJobData][instruction]=Generate+highlight+clips"
```

From the response, note the task `id` (e.g., `98765`).

**Step 2: Poll for completion**

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/reach_entryVendorTask/action/get" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "id=$VENDOR_TASK_ID"
```

Poll every 30 seconds until `status` is `2` (READY) or `6` (ERROR). Typical completion time for AI clips is 30-60 seconds.

**Step 3: List generated clips**

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/baseEntry/action/list" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "filter[rootEntryIdIn]=$KALTURA_ENTRY_ID" \
  -d "filter[statusIn]=1,2,4" \
  -d "filter[orderBy]=-createdAt" \
  -d "pager[pageSize]=500"
```

Each object in the response is a generated clip entry with AI-generated `name`, `description`, `tags`, and `duration`. Note the clip `id`, `duration`, and metadata for the next steps.

**Step 4: Save a clip as a standalone entry**

First, get a source flavor ID for trimming:

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/flavorAsset/action/list" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "filter[entryIdEqual]=$KALTURA_ENTRY_ID"
```

From the response, find a flavor with `status` = `2` (READY) and note its `flavorParamsId` (e.g., `487091`).

Clone the source entry:

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/baseEntry/action/clone" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "entryId=$KALTURA_ENTRY_ID" \
  -d "cloneOptions:item1:objectType=KalturaBaseEntryCloneOptionComponent" \
  -d "cloneOptions:item1:itemType=1" \
  -d "cloneOptions:item1:rule=1"
```

From the response, note the cloned entry `id` (e.g., `1_newclone99`).

Trim the cloned entry to the clip boundaries (offset and duration in **milliseconds**):

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/media/action/updateContent" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "entryId=$CLONE_ENTRY_ID" \
  -d "resource[objectType]=KalturaOperationResources" \
  -d "resource[resources][0][objectType]=KalturaOperationResource" \
  -d "resource[resources][0][resource][objectType]=KalturaEntryResource" \
  -d "resource[resources][0][resource][entryId]=$KALTURA_ENTRY_ID" \
  -d "resource[resources][0][resource][flavorParamsId]=$FLAVOR_PARAMS_ID" \
  -d "resource[resources][0][operationAttributes][0][objectType]=KalturaClipAttributes" \
  -d "resource[resources][0][operationAttributes][0][offset]=0" \
  -d "resource[resources][0][operationAttributes][0][duration]=120000"
```

Set metadata on the saved clip using the AI-generated values from Step 3:

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/media/action/update" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "entryId=$CLONE_ENTRY_ID" \
  -d "mediaEntry[objectType]=KalturaMediaEntry" \
  -d "mediaEntry[name]=Introduction+to+DLI+and+Its+Importance" \
  -d "mediaEntry[description]=Stephen+Wells+introduces+the+session" \
  -d "mediaEntry[tags]=DLI,+Deep+Learning+Institute,+AI+Education" \
  -d "mediaEntry[displayInSearch]=1"
```

The saved clip will go through server-side transcoding (entry status `4` = PENDING) and become `READY` (status `2`) when processing completes.


## Output Types by Service

When a task completes, the result is automatically attached to the entry. The `outputObjectId` field tells you what was created.

| Service Feature | Output Type | How It's Attached |
|---|---|---|
| **Captions** (1) | Caption asset (SRT/DFXP/VTT) | `captionAsset` on the entry, auto-displayed if configured in REACH profile |
| **Translation** (2) | Caption asset in target language | `captionAsset` with target language |
| **Alignment** (3) | Time-synced caption asset | `captionAsset` aligned to audio |
| **Audio Description** (4) | Audio flavor track | `flavorAsset` added to the entry (narration mixed with original audio) |
| **Chaptering** (5) | Cue points | `cuePoint` entries marking chapter boundaries |
| **Dubbing** (7) | Audio flavor track | `flavorAsset` with dubbed audio in target language |
| **Live Caption** (8) | Real-time stream | Captions injected into the live HLS stream via WebSocket |
| **Extended Audio Description** (9) | VTT caption asset | `captionAsset` with `usage=1` (EAD), `displayOnPlayer=false` |
| **Clips** (10) | Child entries | New media entries linked via `rootEntryId` — each with AI-generated name/description/tags. See [AI Clips Workflow](#ai-clips-workflow-content-lab) |
| **Live Translation** (11) | Real-time stream | Translated captions injected into the live stream |
| **Quiz** (12) | Cue points | Quiz question cue points attached to the entry |
| **Summary** (13) | Metadata | Summary and auto-generated chapters applied to entry metadata |
| **Video Analysis** (14) | Metadata | OCR text and visual analysis results applied to entry metadata |
| **Moderation** (15) | Metadata | Moderation flags and scores applied to entry metadata |
| **Metadata Enrichment** (16) | Tags/keywords | Applied to entry metadata |
| **Document Enrichment** (18) | Metadata | Enriched metadata for document entries |
| **Sign Language** (19) | Child entry | New media entry linked via `parentEntryId` |


## REACH Automation Rules

REACH profiles support automation rules that automatically order services when specific conditions are met — no application code required. Rules are evaluated by the `kReachManager` engine whenever content events occur (entry created, entry becomes READY, entry added to category, etc.).

Each rule has **conditions** (when to trigger) and **actions** (what to order):

| Component | API Object Type | Key Field | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Rule | `KalturaRule` | `conditions`, `actions`, `stopProcessing` | Container for one automation rule |
| Boolean Condition | `KalturaBooleanEventNotificationCondition` | `booleanEventNotificationIds` | References Boolean event notification template IDs that define complex conditions |
| Category Condition | `KalturaCategoryEntryCondition` | `categoryId` | Triggers when an entry is assigned to a specific category |
| Action | `KalturaAddEntryVendorTaskAction` | `catalogItemIds`, `entryObjectType` | Auto-orders the specified vendor catalog items |

### How It Works

1. A content event fires (e.g., entry reaches READY status)
2. `kReachManager` loads all active REACH profiles for the partner
3. For each profile, it evaluates the `rules` array:
   - **Boolean conditions** — retrieves the referenced Boolean event notification templates and evaluates their `eventConditions` against the event scope
   - **Category conditions** — checks if the entry belongs to the specified category
   - **No conditions** — rule always triggers
4. If conditions are met, `kReachManager` creates `EntryVendorTask` records for each `catalogItemId` in the rule's action
5. Tasks are created with `creationMode = 2` (AUTOMATIC)

### Configure Rules via Boolean Event Notification Templates

Boolean event notification templates (see [Webhooks API](KALTURA_EVENT_NOTIFICATIONS_WEBHOOK_AND_EMAIL_API.md)) define reusable condition logic — "entry tags match a pattern", "entry status changed to READY", "metadata field contains a value". They evaluate conditions and return true/false — serving purely as filters that REACH rules reference by ID.

**Step 1: Discover available Boolean system templates**

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/eventnotification_eventnotificationtemplate/action/listTemplates" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "filter[objectType]=KalturaEventNotificationTemplateFilter" \
  -d "filter[typeEqual]=booleanNotification.Boolean"
```

**Step 2: Clone a Boolean template for your account**

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/eventnotification_eventnotificationtemplate/action/clone" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "id=$BOOLEAN_SYSTEM_TEMPLATE_ID" \
  -d "eventNotificationTemplate[objectType]=KalturaBooleanNotificationTemplate" \
  -d "eventNotificationTemplate[name]=Entry Ready for Captioning" \
  -d "eventNotificationTemplate[status]=2"
```

Save the cloned template's `id` — this is the `booleanEventNotificationIds` value for the REACH rule.

**Step 3: Add the rule to your REACH profile**

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/reach_reachProfile/action/update" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "id=$REACH_PROFILE_ID" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][objectType]=KalturaRule" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][description]=Auto-caption when Boolean condition met" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][conditions][0][objectType]=KalturaBooleanEventNotificationCondition" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][conditions][0][booleanEventNotificationIds]=$BOOLEAN_TEMPLATE_ID" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][actions][0][objectType]=KalturaAddEntryVendorTaskAction" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][actions][0][catalogItemIds]=$CATALOG_ITEM_ID" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][actions][0][entryObjectType]=1"
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `rules[N][objectType]` | string | Always `KalturaRule` |
| `rules[N][description]` | string | Human-readable rule description |
| `rules[N][stopProcessing]` | boolean | If true, stop evaluating subsequent rules after this one matches |
| `rules[N][conditions][M][objectType]` | string | `KalturaBooleanEventNotificationCondition` or `KalturaCategoryEntryCondition` |
| `rules[N][conditions][M][booleanEventNotificationIds]` | string | Comma-separated Boolean template IDs |
| `rules[N][actions][M][objectType]` | string | `KalturaAddEntryVendorTaskAction` |
| `rules[N][actions][M][catalogItemIds]` | string | Comma-separated vendor catalog item IDs to auto-order |
| `rules[N][actions][M][entryObjectType]` | integer | 1=ENTRY (default), 2=ASSET |

### Category-Based Rules

For simpler triggers, use a category condition — auto-order services when an entry is added to a specific category:

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/reach_reachProfile/action/update" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "id=$REACH_PROFILE_ID" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][objectType]=KalturaRule" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][description]=Auto-caption entries in Training Videos category" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][conditions][0][objectType]=KalturaCategoryEntryCondition" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][conditions][0][categoryId]=$CATEGORY_ID" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][actions][0][objectType]=KalturaAddEntryVendorTaskAction" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][actions][0][catalogItemIds]=$CATALOG_ITEM_ID"
```

### Always-On Rules

A rule with no conditions triggers for every entry that becomes READY:

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/reach_reachProfile/action/update" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "id=$REACH_PROFILE_ID" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][objectType]=KalturaRule" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][description]=Auto-caption all new entries" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][actions][0][objectType]=KalturaAddEntryVendorTaskAction" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][actions][0][catalogItemIds]=$CAPTION_CATALOG_ID,$TRANSLATION_CATALOG_ID"
```

Multiple `catalogItemIds` (comma-separated) orders multiple services simultaneously — e.g., captions and translation in one rule.

### Multiple Rules with Priority

Rules are evaluated in array order. Set `stopProcessing=1` so evaluation stops after the matching rule:

```bash
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][objectType]=KalturaRule" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][stopProcessing]=1" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][conditions][0][objectType]=KalturaBooleanEventNotificationCondition" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][conditions][0][booleanEventNotificationIds]=$NOTIFICATION_ID_1,$NOTIFICATION_ID_2" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][actions][0][objectType]=KalturaAddEntryVendorTaskAction" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][0][actions][0][catalogItemIds]=$CATALOG_ITEM_ID" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][1][objectType]=KalturaRule" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][1][conditions][0][objectType]=KalturaCategoryEntryCondition" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][1][conditions][0][categoryId]=$CATEGORY_ID" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][1][actions][0][objectType]=KalturaAddEntryVendorTaskAction" \
  -d "reachProfile[rules][1][actions][0][catalogItemIds]=$CATALOG_ITEM_ID_2"
```

When rule 0's Boolean conditions are met and `stopProcessing=1`, rule evaluation stops — only rule 0's actions execute.

### Verifying Automatic Task Creation

After triggering an event that matches your rule conditions, verify the task was created automatically:

```bash
curl -X POST "$KALTURA_SERVICE_URL/service/reach_entryVendorTask/action/list" \
  -d "ks=$KALTURA_KS" \
  -d "format=1" \
  -d "filter[objectType]=KalturaEntryVendorTaskFilter" \
  -d "filter[entryIdEqual]=$KALTURA_ENTRY_ID" \
  -d "filter[creationModeEqual]=2"
```

Filter by `creationModeEqual=2` (AUTOMATIC) to see only rule-generated tasks. The task's `reachProfileId` indicates which profile's rule triggered it.


## REACH with Kaltura Agents

When used through the [Agents Manager](KALTURA_AGENTS_MANAGER_API.md), REACH tasks are created automatically. The Agents Manager's Action Definitions API returns `catalogItemId` values that map directly to the REACH `vendorCatalogItem` IDs described in this guide.

- Agents set `creationMode = 2` (AUTOMATIC) on tasks they create
- The agent handles task creation, status tracking, and retry logic
- Results are applied to entries in the same way as manual REACH orders

The Agents Manager supports these REACH services as automated actions: **captions, translation, dubbing, summary, moderation, and metadata enrichment**. For **AI Clips, Quiz, Live Captions, Live Translation, and Video Analysis**, use the REACH API directly via `entryVendorTask.add`. See the [Agents Manager guide](KALTURA_AGENTS_MANAGER_API.md#kaltura-reach--the-services-behind-agent-actions) for the full mapping.

You can mix approaches: use Agents for automated bulk processing, the REACH API directly for on-demand requests, and REACH automation rules for condition-based automatic ordering.


## Dictionaries (Custom Vocabularies)

For machine captioning, you can configure **dictionaries** on your REACH profile to improve accuracy for domain-specific terminology.

- One dictionary per language
- Maximum 8,000 characters
- Words/phrases separated by line breaks
- Configured via the `dictionaries` field on the REACH profile
- Passed automatically to the machine captioning engine with each task

For human captioning, use the `notes` field on the task to provide terminology guidance and context to the human editor.


# 9. Error Handling

| Scenario | What Happens |
|---|---|
| Entry not ready yet | Task starts in PENDING_ENTRY_READY (8), auto-transitions to PENDING (1) when ready |
| Vendor processing fails | Task status becomes ERROR (6), check `errDescription` for details |
| Credit limit exceeded | Task creation fails with an API error |
| Access key expired | Vendor-side issue; key auto-extends based on catalog item TAT |
| KS expired / invalid | API returns 401/403; generate a new KS and retry |
| Kaltura API error | Response `objectType` is `KalturaAPIException` with `code` and `message` fields |

### Common API Error Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ENTRY_VENDOR_TASK_NOT_FOUND` | Task was cancelled/aborted (and deleted) or never existed |
| `ENTRY_NOT_READY` | The entry must have content and be fully processed (status=2 READY) before ordering a task |
| `SERVICE_ACCESS_CONTROL_RESTRICTED` | Verify the `serviceUrl` configuration is correct for your region |
| `INVALID_KS` | KS is expired, malformed, or lacks required privileges |

**Retry strategy:** For transient errors (HTTP 5xx, timeouts), retry with exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, with jitter, up to 3 retries. For client errors (`INVALID_KS`, `ENTRY_VENDOR_TASK_NOT_FOUND`, credit limit exceeded), correct the request before retrying — these require a valid request to succeed. For async operations (task processing), poll with increasing intervals (5s, 10s, 30s) to balance responsiveness with efficiency.


# 10. Best Practices

- **Use REACH Automation Rules for automatic processing.** Set always-on rules or Boolean condition rules on your REACH profile to automatically enrich every new entry — the platform handles per-entry task submission for you.
- **Use Agents Manager for multi-step workflows.** For "caption → translate → summarize" pipelines, use Agents Manager — it handles sequencing, status tracking, and retry logic automatically.
- **Check credit before bulk operations.** Query `reachProfile.get` to compare `credit` vs `usedCredit` before submitting large batches.
- **Use machine captions (serviceType=2) for speed.** Machine captions complete in minutes; human captions take hours. Use machine for time-sensitive content and human for high-accuracy needs.
- **Poll task status with backoff.** Use `entryVendorTask.get` with increasing intervals. For machine captions (serviceType=2), start polling after 30 seconds with 30-second intervals — tasks typically complete in 1-5 minutes. For human captions (serviceType=1), poll every 15-30 minutes — tasks take hours to days depending on the turn-around time. For AI clips, poll every 30 seconds after submission. Prefer webhooks on `ENTRY_VENDOR_TASK` events for the most efficient completion notifications.
- **Use `creationModeEqual=2` filter** to distinguish auto-created tasks (from automation rules) from manually submitted tasks in reports.
- **Use webhooks for task completion notifications.** Set up an HTTP webhook on `ENTRY_VENDOR_TASK` events for real-time status change notifications with minimal overhead.
- **Configure dictionaries for domain-specific content.** Add custom vocabulary (product names, technical terms) to improve machine captioning accuracy.
